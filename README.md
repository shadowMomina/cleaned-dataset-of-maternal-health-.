The dataset underwent several essential preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistency. This included identifying and handling missing or null values, removing duplicate records, correcting inconsistent entries, and converting data types for proper computation. Irrelevant columns and redundant data points were filtered out to maintain focus on the most valuable variables for analysis.

Column names were standardized to follow a clear and readable naming convention, improving data accessibility and making it easier to manipulate through Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Additionally, text-based fields were formatted consistently (for example, proper capitalization, trimmed spaces, and uniform labels), ensuring compatibility during grouping and filtering operations.

The cleaned dataset provides a reliable foundation for exploring key patterns, relationships, and insights through data visualization. It enables seamless integration with visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce meaningful visual summaries — including histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.

In short, the cleaned dataset serves as the backbone of the project — a high-quality, validated data source that demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing in any real-world data analysis workflow. It reflects best practices in data handling and preparation, showcasing the ability to transform raw, messy data into actionable and interpretable information
